# CoP-Planner
A Lesson planner written with the community of Practice at UofT in 2019

This is a file-dump of the lesson planner we made in the 2019 calculus
community of practice. It is maintained by Assaf Bar-Natan. 

A digitally-fillable version is also available upon request, but I'd rather not upload it here, as some of its underlying TeX files are a bit messy.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to e-mail me at
assaf.bar.natan@gmail.com.
